        I'm a born and raised Vancouverite living and working in Toronto. I got
        my bachelor's of applied science at Queen's University (Sci' 19)
        majoring in engineering physics. I currently work as a Software
        Developer at MDA Brampton. Some of my major interests include robotics,
        AI and languages (the human kind). In my free time I like to work on
        code projects and entertain my dreams of becoming a bitcoin millionaire.
